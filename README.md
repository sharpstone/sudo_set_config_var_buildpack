## Force absolute paths buildpack

This buildpack checks that not relative paths have snuck into the PATH or any path like env vars (checks for all that end in PATH like GEM_PATH). The intention of this buildpack is that you could use it in a test suite for buildpacks.

This repo has a very simple script in `lib/check_script.rb` that when executed loops through each PATH-like env var and raises an error if one of them has a relative path.
The script is executed at build time to catch any bad paths in `export` scripts. It also adds (or modifies) a release phase incantation to run at release time so it will check paths in a runtime like environment.

For example:

```
$ git push heroku master
